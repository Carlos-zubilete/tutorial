There are many variations of passages of imput Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration 
in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are 
going to use a passage of imput Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the 
middle of text. All the imput Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary,
making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined 
with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate imput Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated
imput Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
The standard chunk of imput Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. 
Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in 
their exact orig inal form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
